REFRIDGERATORS

Refrigerators work by causing the refrigerant circulating inside them to change from a liquid into a gas.
This process, called evaporation, cools the surrounding area and produces the desired effect. 

You can test this process for yourself by taking some alcohol and putting a drop or two on your skin.
As it evaporates, you should feel a chilling sensation - the same basic principle gives us safe food storage. 

To start the evaporation process and change the refrigerant from liquid to gas, 
the pressure on the refrigerant needs to be reduced through an outlet called the capillary tube.

The effect is similar to what happens when you use an aerosol product such as hair spray. 
The contents of an aerosol can is the pressure/liquid side, the outlet is the capillary tube, 
and the open space is the evaporator.
When you release the contents into the lower pressure open space, it turns from a liquid to a gas.

To keep a refrigerator running, you need to be able to get the gaseous refrigerant back to its liquid state, 
so the gas needs to be compressed to a higher pressure and temperature again, This is where the compressor comes in. 

As mentioned earlier, the compressor provides a similar effect to that of a bike pump. 
You can sense the heat increase in the pump while you pump and compress the air.

Once the compressor has done its work, the gas should be under high pressure and hot. It needs to be cooled in the condenser, 
which is mounted on the back of the refrigerator, so its contents can be cooled by the ambient air. 
When the gas cools off inside the condenser (still under high pressure), it changes back into a liquid.

Then, the liquid refrigerant circulates back to the evaporator where the process starts all over again. 


Refrigerator's main components

Compressor
The compressor is the "heart" of a refrigerator. It circulates the refrigerant throughout the system and adds pressure to the warm part of the circuit, and makes the refrigerant hot. It's similar to when you are pumping air into a bicycle tube - you can sense a heat increase in the pump while you compress the air.

Condenser
The condenser sits on the back of a refrigerator, and is likely quite dusty. Inside, the refrigerant is cooled down and condenses, meaning it turns from a gas back into a liquid.

Evaporator
The evaporator is located inside a refrigerator and is the part that makes the items in the refrigerator cold. As the refrigerant turns from a liquid into a gas through evaporation, it cools the area around it, producing the proper environment for storing food.
 
Capillary tube
The capillary tube is a thin piece of tubing that serves as an expansion device. The liquid refrigerant is routed through the capillary tube and sprayed into the low-pressure environment of the evaporator.

Thermostat
The thermostat controls the cooling process by monitoring the temperature and then switching the compressor on and off. When the sensor senses that it's cold enough inside a refrigerator, it turns off the compressor. If it senses too much heat, it switches the compressor on and begins the cooling process again.

1. The compressor constricts the refrigerant vapor, raising its pressure, and pushes it into the coils on the outside of the refrigerator.

2. When the hot gas in the coils meets the cooler air temperature of the kitchen, it becomes a liquid.

3. Now in liquid form at high pressure, the refrigerant cools down as it flows into the coils inside the freezer and the fridge.

4. The refrigerant absorbs the heat inside the fridge, cooling down the air.

5. Last, the refrigerant evaporates to a gas, then flows back to the compressor, where the cycle starts all over.

Vapor compressor cycle 

Refridgerators work on a simple principle of passing a cold liquid around the object.

Throttling Device(Capillary Tube is used) 
- This produces a cold liquid 
- It obstructs liquid flow and drops the pressure which drops the boiling point 
- the refrigent liquid evaporates 
- energy for the evaporation comes from the liquid 
- so the liquid's temp. drops 
- temp. across the throttling device has a big difference.

Commonly used Refrigerant liquid 
- r134a - Tetrafluoroethane(hydrofluorocarbon[HFC]) 
- HFCs are better than CFCs they dont deplete the ozone layer

evaporator 
- Now from the throttling device the liquid is passed through the body which cools the things stored in fridge

Compressor 
- It increases the pressure of the liquid back to normal 
- with the increase in pressure temperature also increases 

Condensor 
- The condenser sits on the back of a refrigerator
- the refrigerant is cooled down and condenses, 
- it turns from a gas back into a liquid. 
- It releases heat.

-When liquid evaporates it absorbs heat - thus cools things 
-When liquid condeses it realeases heat
